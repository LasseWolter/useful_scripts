- download zen
- open it once AND click through the setup
- close zen
- open ~/.zen folder
- find the profile that ends in '(release)'
- copy all config files into that folder
- start zen
- you should now have all your configs restored
    - get the prefs.js from a machine that's set up because it's not part of this repo

> [!NOTE]
> The pref.js has a disclaimer at the top to not edit it. However, I haven't found another way to copy settings yet.
> I tried using a user.js but that didn't work for me.

UPDATES
[07/08/25] Seems to work now if you copy all config files into the profile that ends in (release)
  - you can also copy the pref.js file from the profile folder on a working machine. It has disclaimer about changing this while running but pasting it while Zen wasn't running and then starting it worked to get the settings from my other setup.
[25/05/25] Overwriting shortcuts by copying and pasting the json file doesn't work properly yet - seems to mess up things in general
